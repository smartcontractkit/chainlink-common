# Cursor Rules Management

## Rule File Organization
- **NEVER use `.cursorrules`** - This format is deprecated
- **ALWAYS create new rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory**
- **Each rule should have its own separate file** with a descriptive name
- Use `.mdc` extension for rule files

## File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `preserve-comments.mdc`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the rule's purpose
- Keep names concise but informative

## Rule File Structure
- Start each rule file with a clear title using `#`
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Group related guidelines under appropriate sections
- Include specific examples when helpful

## Examples of Good Rule Files
- `preserve-comments.mdc` - Code editing guidelines and comment preservation
- `testing-guidelines.mdc` - Testing-specific guidelines and requirements
- `cursor-rules-management.mdc` - This file, managing rule organization

## When Adding New Rules
1. Create a new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Give it a descriptive name following the naming convention
3. Include a clear title and organized sections
4. Focus on a specific aspect of development workflow
5. Update this file if needed to reflect new organizational patterns
