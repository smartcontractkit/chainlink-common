# Testing Guidelines

## Secure Mint Integration Test
When running the Secure Mint integration test, always include the required database environment variable:
```
CL_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://chainlink_dev:insecurepassword@localhost:5432/chainlink_development_test?sslmode=disable go test -timeout 2m -run ^TestIntegration_SecureMint_happy_path$ github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/v2/core/services/ocr3/securemint/integrationtest -v
```
This test requires a PostgreSQL database connection to run successfully.

## General Testing Guidelines
- Always include comprehensive error handling in tests
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Clean up test resources after each test
- Use appropriate timeouts for integration tests
- Include logging for debugging test failures
