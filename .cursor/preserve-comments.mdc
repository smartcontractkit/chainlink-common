# Code Editing Guidelines

## Preserve Important Comments
- **NEVER remove TODO comments** - These contain important information about future work and should be preserved
- **NEVER remove FIXME comments** - These indicate known issues that need to be addressed
- **NEVER remove NOTE comments** - These contain important context for developers
- When editing code, always preserve existing TODO/FIXME/NOTE comments unless explicitly asked to remove them
- If moving code that contains TODO comments, ensure the comments move with the relevant code

## General Guidelines
- Follow existing code style and patterns in the codebase
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation
- Include appropriate logging for debugging
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
